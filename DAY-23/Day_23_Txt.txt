* Sorting :-

-> Use case is to get the target output in less time.
Ex:-
1) Bubble Sort

Time Complexity:-
Best case    - O(n)
Average case - O(n^2)
Worst case   - O(n^2)

-> Compaire adjasent element and it will swap and after an iteration the weigthest and litest element got to end.


2) Selection Sort

Time Complexity:-
Best case    - O(n^2)
Average case - O(n^2)
Worst case   - O(n^2)


3) Insertion Sort

Time Complexity:-
Best case    - O(n) 
Average case - O(n^2)
Worst case   - O(n^2)


4) Merge Sort

Time Complexity:-
Best case    - O(n log n)
Average case - O(n log n)
Worst case   - O(n log n)


5) Quick Sort

Time Complexity:-
Best case    - O(n log n)
Average case - O(n log n)
Worst case   - O(n^2)


6) Count Sort
7) Heap Sort
8) Radix Sort


* Stack :-

-> Stack is special form of data structure. We follow Last in first out(LIFO) and which come in linear data structure.
-> Will get all the output in constant time for all stack operation.
-> There are lot of operation 
   - push()    -> Adding the element in the stack
   - pop()     -> Deleting last element in stack
   - peek()    -> Geting top most element
   - isEmpty() -> cheaking the stack is empty or not
   - display() -> Printing all stack element
   - size()    -> check size

-> First define top = - 1.
-> In the push methode just increse top = top + 1 and store the data in to stack.
-> In the pop methode just decrese top = top -1.
-> In the peek methode just retuen top.
-> In the size methode just return top + 1.



* Queues :- 

-> Queues is data structure. We follow First in first out and it come in linear data structure.
Types of Queues:-
1) Single ended quque :-
-> We can perform the operation from Single side.
2) Double ended quque :- 
-> We can perform the operation from both the side.
3) Priority quque :-
-> Which help to solv heap problems.
    Types :-
    1) min quque :-
    -> Whatever order of element added in quque element will arange in assending order.
    2) max quque :-
    -> Whatever order of element added in quque element will arange in dessending order.
Queues methode :-
1) Offer methode
2) Poll methode
