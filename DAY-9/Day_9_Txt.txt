* Recursion:-
Q:- From a given string we have to remove character using recursion.

-> Assume we are starting with two strings input and output strings. at initial output string is empty.

We have few steps:-
1) Tack the first character form the string and store in character variable
2) Check the variable to a target character. if it matches just return output string else append character
   next slice the string by one character.

-> Whenever input string becomes empty we have to stop the recursion.

Q:- From a given string skip a word and print rest of the character.
Q:- From the given string you have to skip "he" not hello;

* two pointer problem.
 step 1-> initialize the problem accroding to the Que.
 step 2 -> If you are starting 1st pointer at 1st index and second pointer at last index whenever both pointer 
           crosses each other break the loop,in between do the relevant operation.
