* Recursions:-

-> Function call itself and itself till it bit's base condition.
-> There are two types os recursions:-
   1) Function calling an same function call itself and itself. 
   2) function calling an another function call itself and itself.
-> If didn't mantation base condition is called stack overflow.
-> Functions are use to break the code.

Q:- Write the code to print factorial.

-> For every recursive call element will be push into stack after reaching base condition element will be pop.
   our Questation 5,4,3,2,1 push into stack.

code:-
  fact(n){
    if(n==0){
        return 1;
    }
    else{
        return n*fact(n-1);
    }
  } 

* Pass by value and Pass by function
-> Java we don't have pointer so we can't reaching value so java have pointer.
