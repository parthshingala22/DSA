* Dutch natational flag 

-> Intialize three pointer. l 0th index, m 0th index and h is n-1 index.
-> while(m<h){
    if(arr[m] == 0){
        swap(arr[m],arr[l]);
        m++;
        l++;
    }
    else if(arr[m] == 1){
        m++;
    }
    else{
        swap(arr[m],arr[h]);
        h--;
    }
}

* Collectation framework

1) List 
  -> ArrayList
  -> LinkedList
  -> Vector

2) Set
  -> HashSet
  -> LinkedHashSet
  -> TreeSet

3) Map
  -> HashMap
  -> ListHashMap
  -> TreeMap

-> List, Set, Map this are interfashes. test of all are classes.
-> Interfashes contain incomplite methods. class contain complite methods.
-> List is Ordered which can allow duplicates.
-> Set is unordered which can not accepts duplicates.
-> map contains key-value pairs.


Syntex:-

->  Set<Integer> value = new HashSet<>();
