** Switch Case:-

-> cases have to be the same type as expression, must be a  constant or literal.
-> duplicate case values are not allowed.
-> break is use to terminate the sequence.
-> if break is not used, it will continue to next case.
-> default will execute when none of the above does.
-> if default is not at the end, put break after it.


Syntax:-

Switch(expression){
    case :
       Statement;
       break;
    default :
        Statement;
}

        OR

Switch(expression){
    case -> Statement;
    default -> Statement;
}

** Taranary Operator:-

(Condition) ? Statement1 : Statement2;

Ex:-

String res = (n==5) ? ("Yes") : ("No");


** For each loop OR Inhance For loop:-
-> In collections we don't have index values in those setuation wehave to use for each loop

ex:- 

class Day_4_Code{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        int[] arr = {1,2,3,4,5};
        for(int Var : arr){
            System.out.print(Var);
        }
    }
}
