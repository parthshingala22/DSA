* Strings
-> Strings are a classes and arrays are objects the sequence of character called Strings.
-> Strings are imutable. All the array object will be creating heap memory but Strings are created inside a heap.
   ones string are created it will created like fixed it meance it can't modifying 

Ex:-

1) String a = "Hello";
   String b = "Hello";
   System.out.print(a==b);

   -> Output is True because it's both variable point to same object or same location.

2) String a = new String("Hello");
   String b = new String("Hello");
   System.out.print(a==b);

   -> Output is False because it's both variable point to different object or different location.

-> "==" is use to compare the location.

-> System.out.print(a.equals(b)); -> equals are use to compare the data.

-> To gate array length we are using arr.length
-> To gate String length we are using arr.length()

-> Convert String to array and than we have to reverse the string.

* Subset:-
-> For a given array we have to print possible arrays it should in a sequence but nor a continuse thas called subset.
   And in a array if we have n number of element to get 2^n subset.


*Backtracking

ex. of recursion

-> In recursion we have to only two possibilities either if or else. And in Backtracking we have multiple possibilities
   most of the problem whenever we rech base case we have to print all the base case element
-> Remove last element in every recursive call.
